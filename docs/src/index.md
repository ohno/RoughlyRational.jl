## Installation

For the first time only, run the following code in your Jupyter Notebook:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add(path="https://github.com/ohno/RoughlyRational.jl")
```

or use `add` upon Pkg REPL:

```julia
]
add https://github.com/ohno/RoughlyRational.jl
```

## Usage

To use this package, run the following code in your Jupyter Notebook or code:

```@setup usage
using RoughlyRational
```

`maybeinteger(x)` and `RoughlyRational(x)` are available. `maybeinteger(x)` can determine whether `x` is an integer or not, more roughly than `isinteger(x)`:

```@repl usage
x = sin(2Ï€)
isinteger(x)
maybeinteger(x)
```

`roughlyRational` can convert `x` to a rational number more roughly than `Rational(x)`:

```@repl usage
Rational(0.499999)
roughlyRational(0.499999)
```
